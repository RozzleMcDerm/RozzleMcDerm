# Hi there! My name is Rosalind, it's nice to meet you!ðŸ‘‹

**_RozzleMcDerm/RozzleMcDerm_** is âœ¨ _new & evolving_ âœ¨ where I will document my work, the new skills I learn & how I am developing in the world of software engineering 

## A Little bit about me: ##
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **three projects** alongside my studies:
  * _The Old Shop_
  * _The New Buissness_
  * _My Master Plan_
  
> **_The Old Shop_** is a local store based in the North that has existed for a whopping 150 years, passed down through a family, and I will be taking it onto the online world. So that everyone can access its beautiful inventory & learn about the incredible history of the building, the generations of the family that have owned it. But, most importantly, so that everyone in the UK can own their very own peice of the secret in the North.

> **_The New Buissness_** Since Covid, it is fair to say that the public has learned a few things. Let me put two to you...Firstly, board games are underated! Secondly (and most importantly in my opinion) _We all need a little help sometimes_. With that in mind, I will be helping bring the world of CBT therapy online. Closely collaborating with a qualified Therapist, who's one goal is to help people who struggle with anxiety, depression, phobias and how to manage neurodiveristy & doing so in an easy, afforable and accesible way - completely online, bringing therapy to you.

> **_My Master Plan_** to take over the world... Just kidding. With this _top secret_ plan I will be updating you on how it goes, all you need to know for now is that starting a new buissness has never been easier, safer or more accessible.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the _fundamentals of Software Engineering_ with **_CoGrammar_**
> During this course I am learning a vast range of useful and applicable skills on **python** which will help me branch out into the world of Sofware Engineering, as I progress I will keep a _list below_ to update you on how I am doing.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: _she/her_
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have Dylexia, Dyspriaxia & ADHD (my prefered term for this is **NeuroSpicy**) so expect some **Creative Writing & Creative Spelling** from me!
